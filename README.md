The idea is to make use of a fundamental advantage of Blockchain by decentralizing the trading network of sensor data. The network itself consists of several participants: Seller(s), Buyer, Exchange(s) and Data Consumer and is realized on a permissioned blockchain. Sellers are private persons/households with appropriate sensors.  The sensors should be able to supply raw data on air quality. This raw data is offered for sale as an asset. Buyer buys this data by giving the sellers utility tokens.  Buyer analyzes the data, adds additional information and offers it for sale again as an asset. Data Consumer buys this enriched data for cash. In this use case Data Consumer can be an authority, a research centre or even a government. Exchanges are part of the trading network, but have no access to the transactions mentioned above. Sellers and buyers can trade with each other or with the Exchange by exchanging cash for tokens or tokens for cash.  The use case is shown in simplified form in Figure 1.
